# DuckDB Graphalytics implementation

Implementation of LDBC Graphalytics using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org).
This repo is based on [ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_umbra](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_umbra/tree/main).

### Building the project and running the benchmark

1. To initialize the benchmark package, run:

    ```bash
    scripts/init.sh ${GRAPHS_DIR}
    ```

    where `GRAPHS_DIR` is the directory of the graphs and the validation data. The argument is optional and its default value is `~/graphs`.

    This script creates a Maven package (`graphalytics-${GRAPHALYTICS_VERSION}-duckdb-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.gz`). Then, it decompresses the package, initializes a configuration directory `config` (based on the content of the `config-template` directory) and sets the location of the graph directory.

    Note that the project uses the [Build Number Maven plug-in](https://www.mojohaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/) to ensure reproducibility. Hence, builds fail if the local Git repository contains uncommitted changes. To build it regardless (for testing), run it as follows:

    ```bash
    scripts/init-for-testing.sh ${GRAPHS_DIR}
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory created by the `init.sh` script:

    ```bash
    cd graphalytics-*-duckdb-*/
    ```

1. Edit the configuration files (e.g. graphs to be included in the benchmark) in the `config` directory. To conduct benchmark runs, edit the `config/benchmark.properties` file and replace the `include = benchmarks/custom.properties` to select the dataset size you wish to use, e.g. `include = benchmarks/xl.properties`

1. Run the benchmark with the following command:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/run-benchmark.sh
    ```

## Testing the package

If you would like to initialize the benchmark and run it with the default configuration, run the following:

```bash
scripts/package-and-run-benchmark.sh
```

## Numdiff

For manual tests that require epsilon matching, [`numdiff`](https://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/) can be useful. Use it as follows:

```bash
numdiff --absolute-tolerance 0.0001 scratch/output-data/output.csv ~/graphs/pr-directed-test-PR
```
